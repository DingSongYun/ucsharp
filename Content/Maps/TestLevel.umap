This is a placeholder for the test level. In a real UE5 project, this would be a binary .umap file created by the Unreal Editor.
To create a proper test level:
1. Open the project in Unreal Editor
2. Create a new level (File -> New Level)
3. Add some basic geometry and lighting
4. Save it as TestLevel.umap in the Content/Maps folder

For now, this serves as a placeholder to establish the Content directory structure.
